 In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

 The Capomulin drug regimen was the most effective in reducing the average tumor volume in mice over the 45 day period. ![MouseLinePlot](MouseLineplot.jpg)

 Because the study was conducted on both male and female mice almost equally there doesnt appear to be a difference in results based on sex. 
 
 The correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume factors is 0.84 and the regression shows that tumor volume seem to be relatively spread out around the slope.
